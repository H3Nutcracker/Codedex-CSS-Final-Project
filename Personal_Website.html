            <article>Hi. My name is Henry. I´m a digital enthusiast who is learning how to bring his ideas to life in the online world.<br>
                I've been exploring the world of programming on my own, learning the fundamentals of Python, HTML, CSS,<br>
                and JavaScript. Although I still have a lot to learn, I'm thrilled to continue exploring this exciting world<br>
                and creating amazing things. Below in this page you´ll find some links to my recommended sites if you want<br>
                to try and learn some coding on your own. I hope you like what you see!</article>

            <article>Here you´ll find some of the things I´ve made through my journey with Python, HTML, Css and so on. This<br>
            Will continue to expand as I improve my skills and widen my portfolio.</article><br>

            <h3>Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizzard, Spock.</h3>
            <article>
                <a href="https://github.com/H3Nutcracker/Showcase/tree/main/Showcase/Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Scissors%2C%20Lizzard%2C%20Spock">
                    This link</a> will get you to my first poject back when I was learning Python and the first big piece of code I made
                on my own without any guidances or asistance. It was fun to make and althoug today I know it could be simplified to fewer
                lines of code. I´ve chosen to keep the original as it was. Maybe I´ll make a new improved and simplified version in the future

            <h3>Blasteroids</h3>
            <article>
                <a href="https://github.com/H3Nutcracker/Showcase/tree/main/Showcase/Blasteroids">This one</a> was a little more complex. I
                made this game by following a guided tutorial trying to learn to use pygame to build videogames using Python. Although it
                wasn´t fully made on my own its one of the projects I enjoyed more. Maybe I should also add a distributable version.

            <h3>Restaurant Menu</h3>
            <article>
                <a href="https://github.com/H3Nutcracker/Showcase/blob/main/Showcase/Restaurant_Menu.html">This other project</a> was made
                as a final project for the HTML course I took with Codédex. It took me a couple hours to polish it and
                make it look and work as intended, but it was very satisfying to see the final result and get that course certificate.

            <h3>Concert Flyer</h3>
            <article>
                <a href="https://github.com/H3Nutcracker/Showcase/blob/main/Showcase/1.5_Concert_Flyer.html">This next project</a> was part
                of a CSS course I also took with Codédex, continuing with a trilogy of courses dedicated to web development.
                The exercise itself was to make a concert flyer using some code and images provided within the exercise, but i also modified
                it and made a local version as a sort of challenge. I think it looks cool, don´t you?
