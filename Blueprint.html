                Hi! I´m Henry, but I´m known amongst my gaming friends as "H3Nutcracker" or "Knuss". My favorite hobby is gaming<br>
                and sometimes watching a few shows or some movies. In this blog we´ll talk about videogames, tv shows (mainly Star Wars and you <br>
                know, nerd´s stuff in general)

                    <p>The new expansion for the popular MMO World of Warcraft, The War Within was launched at the end of last month. After a period<br>
                    of "early access" for the players who bought the most expensive edition it finally took off. It has been mostly well received within<br>
                    the playerbase, with a few negative aspects being pointed out by part of the community. Read more on the full article about it

                    <p>One of the most anticipated games of the year was launched on August 20th. It inmediately blew up in numbers and reviews. Breaking the<br>
                    record for concurrent players on steam and selling astronomical numbers of copies. But like everything this days on the internet it wasn´t<br>
                    free of controversy. From "specialized news media" pointing out the game´s "lack of diversity and representation" as a negative aspect.<br>

                    <p>Another banger of a game realeased in a month packed with interesting relases. It has very positive reviews from the community<br>
                    and it´s nice to see it triumph after the Helldivers 2 debacle and the controversy with the future Cinematic universe for 40k being<br>
                    produced by Amazon with Henry Cavill at the wheel. We haven´t been able to play it yet, but will be preparing for a future review and<br>
                    a deep dive in the matter soon. Keep an eye out!</p>
